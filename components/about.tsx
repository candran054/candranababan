      <h2 className='text-3xl'>About me</h2>
      <p>Graduated from Institut Teknologi & Bisnis Stikom Bali with{" "}
        <span className='font-medium'>Software Engineer</span> degree.
        I learned the basic programming with <span className='font-medium'>Borland C++</span> there and was taught
        <span className='font-medium'> Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>.
        If im being honest i did not enjoy it at all to the point that i feel like im not cut out to be a Programmer. Until i learn{" "}
        <span>Html & CSS</span>, creating layout, adding image, navbar and changing the color of an element when you hover at the element was
        something that i really enjoy. Then i start learning <span>Javascript</span> to add even more complexity when developing a website. After
        graduating from college i decide i want to become a <span>Frontend Developer</span> and start improving my skill with <span>React</span>.
        I Struggle so much with React but i managed to become good at it, not necessarily a master at <span>React</span> but i improved a lot.
        Then i found <span>NextJS</span> and in my opinion making my job as <span>Frontend Developer</span> much easier, i found it to be better than
        vannila React.
